## MATH 299: Directed Study â€“ Environmental Data Analysis

**Ruby Krasnow**

This website will house my assignments as I work through the course material for [QERM 514: Analysis of Ecological and Environmental Data](https://qerm514.github.io/website/index.html), one of the core requirements for graduate students in the Quantitative Ecology & Resource Management (QERM) program at the University of Washington. The QERM 514 course materials developed and made publicly available online by Dr. Mark Scheuerell will serve as a foundation for a directed study I will complete during my final semester at Clark, supervised by [Michael Satz](https://www.clarku.edu/faculty/profiles/michael-satz/) (Clark University, Department of Mathematics).
