    "text": "1) Who am I & what do I study?\nI am an aspiring marine ecologist with a strong interest in sustainable fisheries and aquaculture. I am especially passionate about using mathematical and statistical models to understand aquatic ecosystems, support sustainable fisheries management, and advance the kelp and shellfish aquaculture industries. I am currently a senior at Clark University, where I am majoring in Biology with a minor in Mathematics. After graduating with my B.A. in December 2024, I will start my PhD in Marine Biology at the University of Maine. I am one of the team captains for the Clark cross-country team and am excited to continue my athletic as well as academic career by competing on the UMaine track and cross-country teams as a graduate student.\nA major focus of my research is enhancing the accuracy of kelp (Saccharina latissima) growth models by incorporating factors such as blade erosion, biofouling, genetic variation, and phenotypic plasticity. Additionally, I am collaborating with the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center to model spatial variation in crustacean size-at-maturity, supporting the sustainable management of the emerging Jonah crab fishery in New England.\nTo learn more about me, you can visit my personal website: https://rmk118.github.io/\n\nKeywords\n\nquantitative marine ecology\nfisheries & aquaculture\n\nkelp aquaculture\nmodeling crustacean size-at-maturity\npopulation dynamics & stock assessment\n\nsynthesis research/meta-analyses\nopen & reproducible data science\n\n\n\n\n2) What do I want from this course?\n\nDevelop a more solid theoretical understanding of the concepts underlying the modeling techniques I frequently use in my research\nLearn new techniques for model selection and inference (e.g., practice cross-validation)\nBecome more familiar with distributions/models that can address common issues in ecological analyses, such as zero-inflated and hurdle models\n\n\n\n3) Plot air quality data\n\nggplot(air)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=wind, y=temp))+\n  theme_light()+ #define custom theme for ggplots\n  theme(\n    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0)),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0)),\n    text=element_text(size=13))+labs(x=\"Wind speed (mph)\", y=\"Temperature (°F)\")+\n  xlim(0,NA)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Avg. wind speed (mph) and max. daily temperature (°F) at LaGuardia Airport, NY, from May-Sept. 1973\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4) Say it with an equation\n\\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\varepsilon  \\tag{1}\\] \\[ \\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\]\nIn Equation 1, the two different predictor variables are represented by \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\)."
